                        stop
                        indicting people with charges punishable by death for participating in peaceful

                    “We urge Iranian authorities to stop using the death penalty as a tool to squash protests and
                    reiterate
                    our
                    call to immediately release all protesters who have been arbitrarily deprived of their liberty for
                    the
                    sole
                    reason of exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of opinion and expression, association and
                    peaceful

                    peaceful
                    means”, they said in a statement.
